Tests for scam_detector.features.duplicate_detection.

All tests that require sentence-transformers are guarded with
``pytest.skip`` when the library is not installed — consistent with the
pattern used in test_features.py.

Real corpus fixtures
--------------------
NayePankh Foundation and Basti Ki Pathshala Foundation fundraising records
are taken verbatim from:
  internScraper/scrapers/intershala_scraper/internships.json

These two organisations post structurally similar fundraising internship text.
See the module docstring for the documented ambiguity and why a
same_parent_organization_allowlist is needed in production.

Unrelated technical records (Anakin, RootSky) are used as true negatives
to confirm the system does NOT flag genuinely different content.
